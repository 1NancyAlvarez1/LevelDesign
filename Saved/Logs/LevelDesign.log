LogAssetRegistry: Display: PlatformFileJournal journal has wrapped for volume 'C:'. AssetRegistry discovery of files on this volume will be uncached. Notes on wrapping:
NTFS Journal has wrapped for volume 'C:'; the number of files written to this volume exceeded the buffer size of the journal and some entries were dropped.
If this happens frequently increase the buffer size of the journal:
Launch cmd.exe as admin and run command `fsutil usn createJournal C: m=<SizeInBytes>`
<SizeInBytes> defaults to 33554432 (32MB), Recommended <SizeInBytes> is 0x40000000 (1GB). You can see the current value via `fsutil usn queryJournal C:`, 'Maximum Size' field.
